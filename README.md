# DungeonsandDragonsWebpage
Final project in Advanced Web Development. April 2016. Using php, css, html. Made to help my friends and I create Dungeons and Dragons characters easier and more efficiently by providing everything needed to us. 

Some of the files were provided to the class such as;
  authenticate.php
  capthcha_code_file.php
  register.php
  login.php //but had to be altered in order to work
  logout.php
