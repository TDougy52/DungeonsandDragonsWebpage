<p><h3>You can click on the class name to jump directly to the class you would like to take a look at.</h3></p>
<p>When choosing a class you will want to make sure that your ability scores have been allocated correctly for that class. The class will say what the main abilities are. Refer to the "General Rule Information" located in each class description.</p>
<p>Each class has what is called a Hit Die or HD. This hit die will be rolled to determine how many hit points you have. Hit points are calculated as Hit Die Roll plus Constitution modifier. Not the ability score but the modifier next to the ability score.
For the first level you do not have to roll as you get the maximum number to roll for your class. Say you were a 1st level Fighter with a Constitution Ability Score of 18. 18 is a +4 ability modifier. Find the Hit Die using the table below.
The fighter has a Hit Die of a d10. So you will have 10+4 giving you a starting HP (Hit Points) of <b><i>14.</b></i>

<b>GAME RULE INFORMATION</b><br>
Barbarians have the following game statistics.
Abilities: Strength is important for barbarians because of its role
in combat, and several barbarian class skills are based on Strength.
Dexterity is also useful to barbarians, especially those who wear light
armor. Wisdom is also important for several of the barbarian&#39;s class
skills. A high Constitution score lets a barbarian rage longer (and
live longer, because it gives him more hit points).<br>
Alignment: Any nonlawful.<br>
Hit Die: d12. <br>
<b>Class Skills</b><br>
The barbarian class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are
Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha),
Jump (Str), Listen (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).
Skill Points at 1st Level: (4 + Int modifier) x 4.
Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 4 + Int modifier.
<br>
<b>Class Features</b><br>
All of the following are class features of the barbarian.
<br>
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A barbarian is proficient with
all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and
shields (except tower shields).
<br>
Fast Movement (Ex): A barbarian land
speed is faster than the norm for his race by
+10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is
wearing no armor, light armor, or medium
armor and not carrying a heavy load. Apply
this bonus before modifying the barbarian’s
speed because of any load carried or
armor worn. For example, a human
barbarian has a speed of 40 feet,
rather than 30 feet, when wearing
light or no armor. When wearing
medium armor or carrying a
medium load, his speed drops to
30 feet. A halfling barbarian has a
speed of 30 feet, rather than 20
feet, in light or no armor. When
wearing medium armor or
carrying a medium load, his
speed drops to 20 feet.
<br>
Illiteracy: Barbarians are the
only characters who do not
automatically know how to read
and write. A barbarian may spend 2
skill points to gain the ability to read and write all
languages he is able to speak.
A barbarian who gains a level in any other
class automatically gains literacy. Any other
character who gains a barbarian level does not
lose the literacy he or she already had.
<br>
Rage (Ex): A barbarian can fly into a
screaming blood frenzy a certain number
of times per day. In a rage, a barbarian
gains phenomenal strength and durability
but becomes reckless and less
able to defend himself. He temporarily
gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a
+4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale
bonus on Will saves, but he takes a –2 penalty to Armor Class.
The increase in Constitution increases the barbarian’s hit points
by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the
rage when his Constitution score drops back to normal. (These extra
hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are; see
Temporary Hit Points, page 146.) While raging, a barbarian
cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based
skills (except for Balance, Escape Artist, Intimidate, and
Ride), the Concentration skill, or any abilities that require
patience or concentration, nor can he cast spells or activate
magic items that require a command word, a
spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell completion
(such as a scroll) to function. He can use
any feat he has except Combat Expertise, item
creation feats, and metamagic
feats. A fit of rage lasts for a
number of rounds equal to 3 +
the character’s (newly
improved) Constitution
modifier. A barbarian
may prematurely end his
rage. At the end of the
rage, the barbarian loses
the rage modifiers and restrictions
and becomes fatigued (–2
penalty to Strength, –2 penalty to Dexterity,
can’t charge or run) for the
duration of the current encounter
(unless he is a 17th-level barbarian, at
which point this limitation no longer
applies; see below).
A barbarian can fly into a rage
only once per encounter. At 1st
level he can use his rage ability
once per day. At 4th level and
every four levels thereafter,
he can use it
one additional time
per day (to a maximum
of six times per day at
20th level). Entering a rage
takes no time itself, but a
barbarian can do it only during
his action (see Initiative, page 136), not in response to someone
else’s action. A barbarian can’t, for example, fly into a rage when
struck down by an arrow in order to get the extra hit points from the
increased Constitution, although the extra hit points would be of
benefit if he had gone into a rage earlier in the round, before the
arrow struck
Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability
to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do
so. He retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if he is caught
flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, he still loses
his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.
If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class (a
barbarian with at least four levels of rogue, for example), he
automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.
Trap Sense (Ex): Starting at 3rd level, a barbarian has an intuitive
sense that alerts him to danger from traps, giving him a +1 bonus on
Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against
attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise by +1 every three
barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap
sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.
Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 5th level and higher, a
barbarian can no longer be flanked; he can react to opponents on
opposite sides of him as easily as he can react to a single attacker.
This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian
by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue
levels than the target has barbarian levels.
If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a
second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny
dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny
dodge stack to determine the minimum level a rogue must be to
flank the character.
Damage Reduction (Ex): At 7th level, a barbarian gains the
ability to shrug off some amount of injury from each blow or attack.
Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time he is dealt
damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every
three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this
damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce
damage to 0 but not below 0.
Greater Rage (Ex): At 11th level, a barbarian’s bonuses to
Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +6, and
his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +3. The penalty to AC
remains at -2.
Indomitable Will (Ex): While in a rage, a barbarian of 14th level
or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment
spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the
morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his rage.
Tireless Rage (Ex): At 17th level and higher, a barbarian no
longer becomes fatigued at the end of his rage.
Mighty Rage (Ex): At 20th level, a barbarian’s bonuses to
Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +8, and
his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +4. The penalty to AC
remains at -2.
